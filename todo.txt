Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Set up a new Next.js project using Turborepo for monorepo management(Tailwind config).
2. Create a package within the monorepo for the wallet logic. 
    This package will handle the connection to the Keplr wallet and all wallet-related functionality.
3. Implement the wallet connection logic using the Keplr wallet API. 
    Allow users to connect their Keplr wallet and retrieve their account information, 
    including their balance on the Osmosis network.
4. Create a UI component that displays the user's connected account information and balance. 
    Use Jotai to store the account information globally, making it accessible throughout the application.
5. Implement the account switching functionality. 
    When the user switches their account, update the global state using Jotai and 
    ensure that the entire website reacts to the account switch.
6. Create a form component for sending transfer transactions. 
    The form should include input fields for the recipient address(es) and the amount(s) to send. 
    Add a plus icon that allows the user to dynamically increase the number of addresses to send to.
7. Implement the transaction signing and sending functionality. 
    Use the Keplr wallet API to sign the transaction and 
    the Cosmos SDK (via cosmjs) to send the transaction to the Osmosis network.
8. Simulate the transaction before sending it to estimate the required gas.
    Use the Cosmos SDK's simulation functionality to estimate 
    the gas based on the aggregated messages in the transaction. Display the estimated gas to the user.
9. Create a dialog component that displays the status of the transaction to the user. 
    Update the dialog in real-time as the transaction progresses (e.g., pending, confirmed, failed).
10. Implement a table component to display the user's previous transactions. 
    Store the transaction data (txHash, target addresses, amounts, timestamps) 
    in the browser's IndexedDB using a library like Dexie.js. 
    Ensure that the transaction data persists through page refreshes.
11. Use Tanstack Query to handle all data queries and mutations. 
    This includes fetching the user's balance, previous transactions, and sending new transactions.
12. Style the UI using Tailwind CSS.
     Keep the design simple but focus on creating fluid interactions 
     Animations using custom Tailwind animations or Framer Motion.
13. (Extra Points) Implement IBC transfer functionality from Osmosis to Cosmos. 
    Display the user's OSMO balance on the Cosmos network.
14. (Extra Points) Create a stepper component to display the states of the IBC transfer process.
15. (Extra Points) Implement IBC hook transfer 
    using the Packet Forward Middleware (PFM) from Osmosis to Cosmos and back to Osmosis.
16. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionality works as expected. 
    Handle edge cases and error scenarios gracefully.
17. Optimize the application for performance. 
    Ensure that the UI remains responsive and fluid, 
    even with large amounts of data or complex transactions.
18. Document the code and provide clear instructions on how to set up and run the application.
